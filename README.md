# Simple Django CMS

Lets make plain.ie simple


## Configuration

Configuration is done in `settings.py` file

`DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = 'en'`

`LANGUAGES = [["en", "English", "ga": "Gaeilge"]]`


## TODO

- file field expects file_url field to be in form, not intuitive enough
- When language is removed from translatable content in images, file remains in file system.
